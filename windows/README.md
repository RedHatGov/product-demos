# Partial README for RBAC

A user "level1" has been created in the "Helpdesk Org" tenancy. This user has the capability to *ONLY* run a patching report. Simply login with the username "level1" and password "Ansible!23" and you can showcase this RBAC functionality. This can also be a way to show how a manager could get a patch report without having to ask his team for it.

As a next step, you can then login as the admin and showcase the patching template that includes the survey etc.
